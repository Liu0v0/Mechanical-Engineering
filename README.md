# Mechanical-Engineering
I am a student majoring in design and manufacturing module of mechanical engineering. I have experienced scientific research competitions and internships during my undergraduate period, and I want to exchange and study with your predecessors, peers and lovers of mechanical engineering on the platform.
I share a planetary / harmonic second stage reducer here. It can be made by yourself using simple 3D printing technology. It is suitable for the reducer used by the simple manipulator with low accuracy requirements for learning.
