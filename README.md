# Mechanical-Engineering
I am a student majoring in design and manufacturing module of mechanical engineering. I have experienced scientific research competitions and internships during my undergraduate period, and I want to exchange and study with predecessors, peers and lovers of mechanical engineering on the platform.
I share a planetary / harmonic second stage reducer here. It can be made by yourself using simple 3D printing technology. It is suitable for the reducer used by the simple manipulator with low accuracy requirements for learning.

This reducer was designed by myself in my sophomore summer course. Considering that the professional knowledge learned at that time was not complete, the design was unreasonable in many details. For example, one screw should not be fixed through three parts at the same time, the axial limit boss of the bearing, etc. But such a two-stage reducer design will still make people feel more interesting. If you find any problems in use, welcome to communicate with me! There is no best design, only better design.
